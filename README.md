# SUMO-Integrated-Perimeter-Control-and-Route-Guidance
This repository implements a multi-scale joint control (MSJC) framework for perimeter control and route guidance integrated with SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility). 

Control Strategies:
1. MSJC: proposed multi-scale joint control of perimeter control and route guidance
2. MSPC: multi-scale perimeter control without route guidance
3. MSPC-LR: multi-scale perimeter control with a logit-based route guidance strategy
4. MP: backpressure control for boundary intersections without route guidance;
5. MP-LR: backpressure control for boundary intersection with logit-based route guidance strategy

The SUMO simulation files are located in the data directory.
